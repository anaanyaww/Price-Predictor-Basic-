# Price-Predictor-Basic-
Real Estate - Price Predictor: Python script predicts housing prices via machine learning. Loads data, trains regressors, selects best model, and saves it for future use.
The script begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from a CSV file. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, including inspecting data types, checking for missing values, and exploring correlations between features and the target variable (housing prices).
